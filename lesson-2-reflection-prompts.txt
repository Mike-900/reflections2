A What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

you can start with tracing files. It makes a new head or master i guess. from now
you can change and track the changes.

git status will give:
On branch master

Initial commit (no commits yet in the new git version  )

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

B How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

it 's some prestate before a commit. In the working directory there are more other files
(possibly). The repository is still empty and waits for the final commit.

C How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change

with git diff you can see the differences between the staging area and the working directory.
wit git --staged you can compare the most recent commit with what you are about to commit.
after you checked it you can see if it is one logical change, not too much changes or
at least an important change.

D What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

when you change the code with some experimentation , during that experimentation you have 
a working version in the masterbranch.
or maybe anouther language version .

E How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

it is made clear from where the branches divert from the master.

What is the result of merging two branches together why do we represent it in the diagram
the way we do?

different works of code get together and we represent it to see where the
different workers of code  diverged.

What are the pros and cons of Gits automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
pros it saves a lot of work, cons it might still be possible to miss something.
