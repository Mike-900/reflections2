A When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

First of all it is reachable by collegues, reachable from other locations, and it is still there
when your pc breaks down

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so you can first check what happened and check if it is a useful change.
maybe some badass put a virus even in place of your program.

C Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

a fork is your own clone like verson on github of someone elses repo where you
can work on without changing the code of the original writer.
a clone is when you put an exact copy from a code from the web on your 
own computer. I guess  you can clone from your own pc towards your own pc too. 
a branch is another deversion from the master just to experiment
