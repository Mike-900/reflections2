A When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

First of all it is reachable by collegues, reachable from other locations, and it is still there
when your pc breaks down

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so you can first check what happened and check if it is a useful change.
maybe some badass put a virus even in place of your program.
